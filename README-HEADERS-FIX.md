# Fixing the next/headers Import Error

The error you're seeing is because `next/headers` is being imported in a component that has a parent marked with "use client". This is not allowed because `next/headers` is a Server Component API and can't be used in Client Components.

## How to Fix

1. **Identify the problematic component**:
   Look for components that import from `next/headers` and have a parent component marked with "use client".

2. **Replace the imports**:
   - For Server Components (no "use client" directive):
     \`\`\`tsx
     // Before
     import { cookies, headers } from 'next/headers';
     
     // After
     import { cookies, headers } from 'next/headers';
     // No change needed for Server Components
     \`\`\`

   - For Client Components (with "use client" directive or with a parent that has it):
     \`\`\`tsx
     // Before
     import { cookies, headers } from 'next/headers';
     
     // After
     import { getCookieCompat, getHeaderCompat } from '../lib/headers-compat';
     // Or use the hooks for functional components
     import { useCookie, useHeaders } from '../lib/headers-compat';
     \`\`\`

3. **Update the usage**:
   - For Server Components:
     \`\`\`tsx
     // No change needed
     const cookieStore = cookies();
     const headersList = headers();
     \`\`\`

   - For Client Components:
     \`\`\`tsx
     // Before
     const cookieStore = cookies();
     const headersList = headers();
     const myCookie = cookieStore.get('my-cookie');
     
     // After
     const myCookie = getCookieCompat('my-cookie');
     // Or with hooks
     const myCookie = useCookie('my-cookie');
     \`\`\`

4. **For authentication**:
   - In Server Components, use:
     \`\`\`tsx
     import { getServerUser } from '../lib/auth-utils';
     
     const user = await getServerUser();
     \`\`\`

   - In Client Components, use:
     \`\`\`tsx
     import { getClientUser, useUser } from '../lib/auth-client';
     
     // In an async function
     const user = await getClientUser();
     
     // Or with hooks
     const { user, loading } = useUser();
     \`\`\`

## Common Places to Check

1. Layout components
2. Authentication components
3. Components that handle cookies or headers
4. API route handlers

Remember, any component that imports from `next/headers` must be a Server Component, and all of its parents must also be Server Components.
